# Parallel Programming Techniques 

The assessment of this practical work in based on the completion of 7 practical
assignment sheets, each consisting of approximately 3 programming exercises.
The scope of the assignments is to assess the ability of the students to analyse a
computational problem and to develop efficient programming solutions. Thus
addressing the LO3 of the module. 

Module Learning Outcomes:
1. Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how large-scale parallel systems are built
2. Apply mathematical foundations and algorithmic principles to the modelling and design of computer based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the trade-offs involved in design choices
3. Write efficient parallel programmes for different applications with MPI, OpenMP and PThread.
